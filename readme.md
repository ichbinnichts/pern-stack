//Before initializing the server, download postgreSQL and follow the steps in database.sql and configure the database in db.js
//initialize the server in the package "server" with $node start

### DEPENDENCIES ###

//PostgreSQL
//Express.js
//ReactJS
//Node.js

### HOW TO START THE PROJECT ###
//First go to your psql and create a database with a "database_name"(any name you want), and create a table "todo"(this has to be this name because of the code), after this you have to go to db.js and configure your database. Now just go to the folder /server and run the code $node index.js. To start client side go to the folder /client and run the code npm start
### NOTES TO MYSELF ###
